City Bike Analysis for NYC to Support Des Moines Project

Overview and Analysis:
Using Data already collected for just one month from New York City, build a model idea for the City of Des Moines to potentially bring the same system to the city for public use and also create visualations to impress potential buyers.  There are many questions that need to be answered whe nattempting to atart a bike sharing business in a new city.  How many trips will people take?  Do more men or women utilize the serivice and how can we cater to the most people to gain the most business? Where in the city should bike pick-up and drop-off stations be located?  What times of day are the bikes used the most and by whome for what purpose? 

Results:
* We found how many rides were taken in one month: 2,344,244
* Short term users vs. subscribers: 443,865 users; 1,900,359 subscribers
* peak riding hours overall are around 8am and 5-6pm
* created a visual map for where rides were started and ended, where is the most     
    popular locations of usage for each.  
* Found out by creating a pie chart and heat map by gender usage, that men make up a 
    majority of the subscribers an use the bike share more than women.
* Looked at expenses, considered bike maintenence would be among the top and createe 
    a grid to show us which bikes get used more so we know which ones will need to be serviced and how often.  If they are used more, they will need to be checked more often than those that are not used as often.

Summary:
The data from New York shows that a mojority ofthe bike rides were under 30 minutes, with a high peak at around 5 minutes of duration.  Most of the bike rides during the week were in the morning beteween 6 and 7 am or in the evenings from 5 - 7 pm, so that leads me to beleive a lot of the riders were going to or from work.  A mojority of the bike rides on the weekends occured between 10 am and 5 pm.  My guess would be people running errands after sleeping in or headed to a differnet part of town for the day.  A majority of the subscribers were male and there was a higher volume of male riders as well.  This could be, possibly, because if women were working and looking for a mode of transportation to work and they are dressed up, they may not even be able to ride a bike in a skirt or heels.  So a lot depends on who utilizes the bike and for what purpose.  We also looked at cost. The subscribers would bring in a majority of the revenue and the highest running cost would be bike maintanence. We looked at which bikes get used the most so we knew which would need servicing more often.  We also need to look and see at maybe the routes of the bikes.  Do the same bikes get taken from the same pick-up/drop-off locations points daily or the quantity of them?  This may give us a better idea if we need to increase the amount of bikes available at any one pick-up/drop-off location. Would Des Moines have a cluster of usage?  If the majority of the bike rides are around 5 minutes, how many miles does that on average take the rider?  Maybe adding GPS trackers to find the paths or travel for each bike so we could put more pick-up/drop-off locations along those routes?  What stores or places of employment are people going to so more or less pick-up/drop-off locations could be added near businesses.
